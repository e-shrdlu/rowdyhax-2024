## RaptorWatch Browser Extension
### What does RaptorWatch do?
RaptorWatch is a general browser extension meant to combat malicious typo-squatting links. RaptorWatch stops the page from opening on the user's browser and notifies them that they have likely just clicked on a malicious link. 

### What is typosquatting?
Typosquatting is the practice of registering a domain with a similar name to a trusted site, but with a typo in it. For example, someone may typosquat the domain `youtube.cm` when the user really meant to go to `youtube.com` but forgot the 'o' when typing in the url. These links are commonly used in phishing attacks against companies and individuals to perform malicious actions and abuse trust in what the user thinks is a legitimate site.

### Why is RaptorWatch useful?
Our product is important because phishing attacks are one of the most common ways organizations can be breached. By proactively blocking such links with RaptorWatch, companies can mitigate the risk of data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage.

### How are we different from other solutions?
RaptorWatch is different because it is. Source: Trust me bro
