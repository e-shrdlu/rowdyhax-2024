    <h1>WARNING: Malicious Site Detected ❗❗</h1>
    <p>We have detected that you have attempted to visit a potentially malicious website. For your safety and security, we strongly advise against accessing this site.</p>
    <p>The website you tried to visit: <a id="malicious-link" href="#" target="_blank">[Insert Malicious Site URL Here]</a></p>
    <p>If you believe this is a mistake, please contact our support team immediately via email at support@rhproject.org.</p>
    <p>We detect malicious links through recognizing misspellings of common website names (typosquatting) and other industry-proven methods to detect possible attempts at malicious downloads, phishing, and more. <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/typosquatting-types-prevention.html" target="_blank">Typosquatting</a> is the practice of registering a domain with a similar name to a trusted site, but with a typo in it. These sites are used to lure in victims who believe the site to be a trusted link.</p>
